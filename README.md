Activity Log
========================================

This is a very early demo (but mostly functional) version of the activity log.
The purpose of this system is provide a place for system administrators or
operators to document changes to systems (upgrades, restarts, everything!) and
make that information freely available to all others in an organization.

Automated systems (i.e. jenkins) can post changes via the API (though it is
not fully implemented yet).

This is a work in progress so use it at your own risk.
